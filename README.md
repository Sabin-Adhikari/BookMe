# BookMe
BookMe is a Android Studio Project written in Java and XML. It is a basic hotel booking app, and uses external libraries like 
Paypal Android SDK v2.14.2 (for online payment), GSON v2.8.9 (convert and parse JSON) and Google Play Location Services v18. Just clone the repo, import it in
Android Studio and let it do all the heavy lifting for you. Happy Coding!
